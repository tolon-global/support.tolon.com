<p>
The tolon logo is constructed using <em>Futura Std Light</em> typeface, using +50
letter tracking as shown <span class="narrow">below</span><span class="wide">aside</span>.
It should not be constructed by any other means. Preferably, the provided vector
file should be used, and if the logo must be reconstructed using the typeface,
the tracking and kerning values must match the original. Any other variant of the
Futura Std typeface, or other typefaces in the Futura family must never be used.

<p>
The logo can be used at different scales, but its aspect ratio (the proportion of its width
to its height) must never be changed. The correct aspect ratio can be verified from
the perfect circularity of the two O letters in the logo. An incorrect aspect ratio
will cause them to be elliptical. The logo must also never be used vertically or at an
angle. The letterforms must never be outlined.
</p>

<p>
The logo must always be used in its pure form, never with any visual effect that will
alter its appearance. It must also always be used as printed letterforms, never embossed
or cut out.

<h3>Color use</h3>

<p>
The color of the logo is determined in accordance with these guidelines and constraints
of the medium it will be used in. On a white background, the color of the logo must
always be the cold gray defined by <code><abbr title="Natural Color System">NCS</abbr>â„¢ S 7005-B20G</code>.
For screen usage, the equivalent RGB code can be taken as <code>R:56, G:63, B:70</code>, or
<code>#383F46</code> in <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>.
This color can also be used as the background color, in which case, the logo itself must be white.
</p>

<p>

    On <abbr title="Black and white">B&amp;W</abbr> prints or other monochromatic
    media, the logo and its background must be the darkest and lightest colors in
    the medium, never any shade or tint in between.
</p>

<p>
    In color media, the logo must never be used in any color other than as specified
    in this guide. The only exception is monochrome media where color reproduction
    is irrelevant, in which case the previous rule must be followed.
    The logo or its background must never have any texture or gradient.
</p>

<h3>Placement</h3>

<p>
    The logo must have a padding zone around itself, free of any other visual
    elements. This zone is constructed as shown, using the width of the T
    letterform in the logo.
</p>

<p>
The logo can be used in any one of the four corners of a rectangular page or screen.
If the logo is in a corner, then the spacing between the closer two edges and the logo must
exactly match the previous padding rule. If the logo is inside the page by more than
the width of two N letterforms, then this rule can be ignored.
</p>

<h3>Gray strip</h3>

<p>

In corporate documents, unless impossible, the logo must be used inside a gray strip
spanning the top or bottom edge of the page. The logo can be on either side of the gray strip.
</p>

<p>

The gray strip may also contain a page title or other titular detail. If used, such a
title must be aligned to the opposite edge of the logo.
</p>
<img src="tolon-greyblock-headings.svg" alt="Tolon logo gray strip titles" />
<p>
    The padding rule must be followed in the gray strip as well, keeping the
    logo the exact width of the T letterform from the edges of the strip.
</p>

<h3>Color square</h3>

<p>
    Where the gray strip is used, a color square may also be used if there is enough space.
    The color square is always used together with the logo, never by itself.
    It must be one of the colors defined <span class="narrow">below</span><span class="wide">aside</span>.
</p>

<img src="tolon-colorsquare.svg" alt="Tolon logo color square"/>
<p>
    The color square must touch the left or right edge of the gray strip. There must never
    be any space between the color square and the chosen side edge. The other three sides of
    the square must be encompassed by the gray strip.
</p>
<img src="tolon-colorsquare-wrongsquare.svg" alt="Tolon logo color square incorrect usage"/>
<p>
    The color square is an exact square, never a rectangle, at the exact height of the leterform T in the logo,
    and vertically aligned with it. It cannot be used in any other placement.
